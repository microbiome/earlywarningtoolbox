This repository contains the R package toolbox for analysing Early Warning Signals for Critical Transitions. The Toolbox exists for download under different operating systems in R Forge (http://earlywarnings.r-forge.r-project.org/) and also is submitted to CRAN.

From this repository it will be also possible to install the toolbox directly to R by install_git(devtools).

The project is based on Dakos V, Carpenter SR, Brock WA, Ellison AM, Guttal V, et al. (2012) Methods for Detecting Early Warnings of Critical Transitions in Time Series Illustrated Using Simulated Ecological Data. PLoS ONE 7(7): e41010. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0041010
